# Iowa Liquor Dataset - Choosing a Location

This project analyzes the Iowa Liquor Dataset, available for download at 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pf5n5sgfgiri3i8/AACkaMeL_i_WgZ00rpxOOcysa?dl=0 (this dataset is very large). The state of Iowa requires all liquor stores to purchase their stock from the state government at a markup. This dataset contains information on all of those purchases such as the location of the store and the type and amount of liquor purchased.

The specific goal of this project was to determine the best location to open a new liquor store. I also built a model to predict total sales and used that to inform some suggestions on how to stock the liquor store.
