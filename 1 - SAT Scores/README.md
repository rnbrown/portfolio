# SAT SCORES

This data, taken from the College Board, gives the mean SAT math and verbal scores and the participation rate for each state and DC for the year 2001. 

In this project, I explored the data, I created some simple visualizations of the data, and I explored key relationships between the mean verbal score, mean math score, and SAT participation rates on a statewide basis.
