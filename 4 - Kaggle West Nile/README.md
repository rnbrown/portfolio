# Kaggle West Nile Virus Challenge
### A group project by Beguiling West Niling

Members include:

* Russell Brown

* Stephanie Jones

* Mukul Ram

* Brice Wolfgang

During this group project, we undertook the task of making accurate predictions for Kaggle's West Nile Virus Challenge.

The specs. of the challenge asked us to look at a combination of mosquito information, weather information, and spray information over the years, and make predictions based on them. The goal was to predict at which locations (mosquito traps) and in which mosquito species West Nile Virus would be found.

We were expected to refine a problem statement, wrangle the given data, engineer new and relevant features, build a capable model, create a cost-benefit analysis of Zenivex spraying, and make a presentation on all of the former.
