# Global Terrorism Dataset

The global terrorism dataset contains data on all known terror attacks worldwide since 1970. It is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) which is headquartered at UMD. The data is available through Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd

The first specific goal of this project was to choose two populations of interest and statistically determine the difference in some parameter between the two. For this portion of the project, I chose to compare the average number of terror attacks per month in 2007-2011 and 2012-2016. 

The second goal of the project was to impute the number of each category of terror attacks in the year 1993. All of the 1993 data is currently missing from the dataset.
