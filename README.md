# Some data science projects that I worked on during my time at General Assembly.

## Project 1 - A short project where I analyzed a dataset on average SAT scores on a statewide basis.

## Project 2 - Recommendations to a potential new liquor store owner in Iowa based on state government data.

## Project 3 - Scraped data-science-related job postings and built a model to predict the best jobs to apply for.

## Project 4 - Used mosquito trap data from the city of Chicago to predict outbreaks of West Nile Virus. A Kaggle competition.

## Project 5 - The Global Terrorism Dataset contains all documented terror attacks worldwide since 1970. I statistically compare the rate of attacks in Iraq from 2007-2011 and 2012-2016. I then built a model to impute the missing 1993 data.

## Project 6 - My capstone project. Built a model to predict if somebody would be approved for a mortgage or not using the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act database. Analyzed the results to determine whether there was any evidence of racial discrimination.
