# Capstone Project

In this project I analyzed the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data from 2015 for any evidence of racial discrimination. Specifically, I used Bayesian inference to statistically determine the difference between different racial groups in terms of loan acceptance rates. I then fit a predictive model to the data to see how important race was to that model's predictions. Finally, I fit an inferential model to the same data to determine how much of an effect race had on the odds of being approved for a mortgage.
